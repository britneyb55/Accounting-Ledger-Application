# Accounting-Ledger-Application


The Accounting Ledger application, named Tracking Financial Footprints, keeps track of all your deposits and payments. In addition to this, the Accounting Ledger also includes a unique feature of providing you with various types of reports with detailed information about a purchase and deposits being made. This information is recorded in a transaction file with date, time, and a short description about the transaction. It also includes the vendor name and the amount that was entered.
